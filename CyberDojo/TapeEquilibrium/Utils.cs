                This is the first solution I came up with which was really bad in terms of perf.
                Benchmark tests showed that it was not really O(N).
                I realised that I really didn't have to resum every time inside the loop. Instead,
                I could have only done it once and subtract from there. I realise that this is 
                still not O(N) but it terms of perf, it's a bit better.
